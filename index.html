            <h3>REASON FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL AFRICA</h3>
            <p>Ever since i was young, i have always loved how the computer and computer software works even though i never had the chance to learn from a proper computer training center because going to school was a luxury back then and no one owned a PC in my house.<br>
            Fast forward to my uni days, i was able to save up and buy a fairly used laptop which i used to teach myself the basic operations on the computer.<br>
            Few years down the line, i feel like i have superpowers whenever i accomplish simple task for my colleagues at the office, especially the ones that would involve getting help from the IT department.
            In 2023, i decide to take my love for tech to another level by enrolling in a tech school. After searching back and forth for some months on which to apply to, i found an advert from AltSchool Africa and i immediately pick interest in them.
